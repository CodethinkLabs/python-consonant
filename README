python-consonant
================

python-consonant is a reference implementation of Consonant. It is
written in Python and designed to allow rapid development of command
line applications and web services to run on top of Consonant stores.


What is Consonant?
------------------

Consonant is an object-relational, cross-referenced, verifiable and
service-oriented Git object store and corresponding web API.

The Consonant specification is hosted on

  https://github.com/CodethinkLabs/consonant


Dependencies
------------

python-consonant depends on the following software components:

  * Python >= 2.7.0
  * PyYAML >= 3.10 (with libyaml support)
  * pygit2 >= 0.19.0
  * pylibmc >= 1.2.2
  * python-twisted >= 11.1.0
  * python-twisted-web >= 11.1.0

For running the python-consonant test suite, the following additional
components are required:

  * python-coverage-test-runner >= 1.9
  * pep8 >= 1.4.8
  * pep257 >= 0.2.4
  * memcached >= 1.4.15
  * cmdtest >= 0.9
  * git >= 1.8.0


Testing
-------

python-consonant comes with an elaborate test suite with the following
features:

  * License checking of all source files
  * Unit tests
  * Scenario tests
  * Coding style checks (PEP 8, PEP 257)

These tests can be executed with

    python setup.py check

from the root directory of the source tree. The scenario tests are
executed against a standard set of test schemas and stores. By default,
these are expected to be located in the parent directory of
python-consonant but this can be overriden by providing a different
base URL, e.g.

    TEST_REPO_BASE_URL=/path/to/the/test/repos \
        python setup.py check


Building & Installing
---------------------

Like most Python projects, python-consonant can be using the standard
commands

    python setup.py build
    sudo python setup.py install

from the root directory of the source tree.
