Fetching information about refs from a store
============================================

List all refs in a store
------------------------

Fetch a list of all refs in a store:

    SCENARIO fetch all refs in a store
    GIVEN    the standard test store "consonant-test-store-01"

Make sure the number of refs is as expected (2 branches, 2 tags):

    THEN     the result contains exactly 4 refs

Make sure all the expected branches are present:

    AND      the result includes a branch called "HEAD"
    AND      the result includes a branch called "master"

    AND      the branch "HEAD" has exactly 1 alias

    AND      the branch "master" has exactly 2 aliases
    AND      the branch "master" has an alias "master"
    AND      the branch "master" has an alias "refs:heads:master"

Make sure all the expected tags are present:

    AND      the result includes a tag called "initial-data-set"
    AND      the result includes a tag called "second-commit"

    AND      the tag "initial-data-set" has exactly 2 aliases
    AND      the tag "initial-data-set" has an alias "initial-data-set"
