Black box tests for the consonant.store module
==============================================

The scenario tests in this document aim to provide extensive coverage
of the `consonant.store` module, which provides a Python API to access
Consonant stores.

The tests operate against a set of public test schemas and stores, all
of which are given names like `simple kanban store`. These test stores
have specific properties such as particular branches, tags or commits
being present, so it may not always be obvious why a scenario test is
correct.

Listing all Git refs in a store
-------------------------------

    SCENARIO list Git refs in a local store using consonant.store
    GIVEN    a local standard test store "consonant-test-store-01"
    WHEN     listing Git refs using consonant.store

Make sure all the expected local branches are present:

    THEN     the refs include a local branch called "HEAD"
    AND      the refs include a local branch called "master"
    AND      the local branch "HEAD" has an alias "HEAD"
    AND      the local branch "master" has an alias "master"
    AND      the local branch "master" has an alias "refs:heads:master"

Make sure all the expected remote branches are present:

    AND      the refs include a remote branch called "origin/HEAD"
    AND      the refs include a remote branch called "origin/master"
    AND      the remote branch "origin/HEAD" has an alias "origin:HEAD"
    AND      the remote branch "origin/HEAD" has an alias "refs:remotes:origin:HEAD"
    AND      the remote branch "origin/master" has an alias "origin:master"
    AND      the remote branch "origin/master" has an alias "refs:remotes:origin:master"

Make sure all the expected tags are present:

    AND      the refs include a tag called "initial-data-set"
    AND      the refs include a tag called "second-commit"
    AND      the tag "initial-data-set" has an alias "initial-data-set"
    AND      the tag "initial-data-set" has an alias "refs:tags:initial-data-set"
    AND      the tag "second-commit" has an alias "second-commit"
    AND      the tag "second-commit" has an alias "refs:tags:second-commit"
