Black box tests for the consonant.store module
==============================================

The scenario tests in this document aim to provide extensive coverage
of the `consonant.store` module, which provides a Python API to access
Consonant stores.

The tests operate against a set of public test schemas and stores, all
of which are given names like `simple kanban store`. These test stores
have specific properties such as particular branches, tags or commits
being present, so it may not always be obvious why a scenario test is
correct.

Listing Git refs and commits
----------------------------

    SCENARIO list Git refs in a local store using consonant.store
    GIVEN    a local simple kanban store
    WHEN     listing Git refs using consonant.store
    THEN     the refs include a branch called master
    THEN     the refs include a branch called HEAD
    THEN     the refs include a tag called initial-data-set
